# Full Javascript Course
> My journey in learning javascript and it's amazing features, I realized that documenting information/knowledge helps stick it up the brain's memory and helps in polishing the language you are using to document, and helps improve communication skills as this requires writing skills that allows others to read and understand the context. Enjoy my version of the basics of Javascript Programming Language


### 2. Hello World
##### 2.1 Javascript on the web console
Use any web browser to access the web console, you can write javascript code on a console found on developer tools that most browsers ships with. By pressing F12 while a tab is opened, you will have access to developer tools, then look for 'console' on the top tabs of the developer tools. This can be achieved by right clicking on a page(empty or not) then choose 'inspect'

You can run functions like 'clear()', 'console.log('Hello World')' on the console and many other javascript functions or code.

##### 2.1 Javascript on a script tag
Javascript can also be written on a HTML file by using the '\<script\>' tag, write your code of choice inside the tag. However the results of the output from running js this way can be debugged by using the console utility mentioned above.

##### 2.3 Javascript on a text editor
Alternatively you can write javascript on a file with the extension '.js', this is the recommended way to write javascript code. The code from a javascript file can be linked to a HTML file using the '\<script\>' tag as before but this time you reference the file using a path.

The script tag can be used in the head part of the html or in the body, depending on when you want your code to load. Include it in the head if you want it to be rendered on load and include it in the body if you want it to load after everything.

##### 2.3 Javascript commenting style
use /* */ for multiple lines.
e.g: 

`/* many
    many 
    many
    lines */
`

and // for single lines.

`
// One line
`
