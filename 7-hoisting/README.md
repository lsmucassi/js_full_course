# Full Javascript Course
> My journey in learning javascript and it's amazing features, I realized that documenting information/knowledge helps stick it up the brain's memory and helps in polishing the language you are using to document, and helps improve communication skills as this requires writing skills that allows others to read and understand the context. Enjoy my version of the basics of Javascript Programming Language

### 7. Variables Hoisting & Stop
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

One of the advantages of JavaScript putting function declarations into memory before it executes any code segment is that it allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code. For example:

`
function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}

catName("Tiger");

/*
The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
`

The above code snippet is how you would expect to write the code for it to work. Now, let's see what happens when we call the function before we write it:

`
catName("Chloe");

function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}
/*
The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Chloe"
*/
`

Even though we call the function in our code first, before the function is written, the code still works. This is because of how context execution works in JavaScript.

Hoisting works well with other data types and variables. The variables can be initialized and used before they are declared.

Only declarations are hoisted
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. If a variable is declared and initialized after using it, the value will be undefined. For example:

`
console.log(num); // Returns undefined, as only declaration was hoisted, no initialization has happened at this stage
var num; // Declaration
num = 6; // Initialization
`

You can not access a variable before it's initialized or declared but you can use a variable that was initialized without declaration and declare it later

When you use 'let' or 'const' hoisting will not apply, your code will give an error
